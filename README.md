# WSL Setup
A quick simple guide to download setup WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

## Installation
The easiest way to install WSL is through the command prompt/terminal. The command prompt can be opened by pressing Windows Key + R. A small window will open and there will be a textbox next to the words "Open". Type "cmd" in the textbox and press enter.
Alternatively you can open the command prompt by searching for it in the start menu.
