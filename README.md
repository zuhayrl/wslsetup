# WSL Setup
A quick simple guide to download setup WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

## Installation
The easiest way to install WSL is through the command prompt/terminal. The command prompt can be opened by pressing Windows Key + R. A small window will open and there will be a textbox next to the words "Open". Type "cmd" in the textbox and press enter.
Alternatively, you can open the command prompt by searching for it in the start menu.

Once you have the terminal open you want to enter the following:

```sh
wsl --install
```

It should look like this:
